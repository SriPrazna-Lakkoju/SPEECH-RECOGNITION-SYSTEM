DESCRIPTION:

WHAT IS IT?

A Speech Recognition System is a project that listens to your voice and understands specific words or commands. It lets you control devices or perform actions by speaking, instead of pressing buttons.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

You speak a command (like “Turn on light”).
A speech recognition module (like Voice Recognition Module V3) listens and matches your voice with stored commands.
The module sends the recognized command to a microcontroller (like Arduino).
The Arduino then performs an action — like turning on a fan, light, or any device.

COMPONENTS:

Component	Purpose
Arduino UNO/Nano	Main controller
Voice Recognition Module (e.g., V3 or Elechouse)	To recognize voice commands
Microphone (built-in)	To capture your voice
Relay module / LEDs	To show the result or control devices
Jumper wires + Breadboard	For connections
MIT app
