# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM

What is it?
A Speech Recognition System is a project that listens to your voice and understands specific words or commands. It lets you control devices or perform actions by speaking, instead of pressing buttons.

üîπ How does it work?
You speak a command (like ‚ÄúTurn on light‚Äù).

A speech recognition module (like Voice Recognition Module V3) listens and matches your voice with stored commands.

The module sends the recognized command to a microcontroller (like Arduino).

The Arduino then performs an action ‚Äî like turning on a fan, light, or any device.

üîπ What You Need (Components):
Component	Purpose
Arduino UNO/Nano	Main controller
Voice Recognition Module (e.g., V3 or Elechouse)	To recognize voice commands
Microphone (built-in)	To capture your voice
Relay module / LEDs	To show the result or control devices
Jumper wires + Breadboard	For connections
